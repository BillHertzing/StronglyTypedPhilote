# Landing page (index.md -> index.html) for  ATAP.Utilities.AutoDoc 

Welcome to the documentation site for the ATAP Utilities. This site contains information on building and using the ATAP Utility assemblies. It also has articles on how the utilities are built, and distributed.

I am actively developing this documentation static website, and publishing to the ATAP Utilities GitHub Pages host. Over the course of the next few weeks, the site will be in a constant state of flux, but hopefully will settle down after the automation tools are completed and content is written.
